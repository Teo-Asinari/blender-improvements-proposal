# Blender Improvements Proposal

A project proposing enhancements to Blender's sculpting, texture painting, and UX — inspired by workflows in 3DCoat, Substance Painter, and other specialized 3D tools.

## What This Is

This repository contains a detailed proposal for bringing key missing features to Blender, either as add-ons/plugins or as upstream contributions to the Blender project. The focus areas are:

- **Voxel-Based Sculpting** — topology-free sculpting with real-time booleans, similar to 3DCoat's Voxel Room
- **PBR Texture Painting with Layers** — a proper layer stack, simultaneous multi-channel PBR painting, template materials, and GPU-accelerated performance
- **Interactive Brush Controls** — 3DCoat-style right-click drag to adjust brush size and intensity in a single gesture
- **UX & Navigation Improvements** — viewport navigation and workflow enhancements drawn from 3DCoat

## Documents

## Status

Early research and planning phase. This is a living document that will be updated as technical research progresses and implementation strategies become clearer.

## Contributing

Ideas, research, and discussion are welcome. Open an issue or submit a PR.
